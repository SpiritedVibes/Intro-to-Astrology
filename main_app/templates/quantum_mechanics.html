            <h1>Introduction to Quantum Mechanics</h1>
            <p>Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies the behavior of matter and energy at the smallest scales,
                 such as atoms and subatomic particles. It emerged in the early 20th century as scientists sought to explain phenomena
                  that classical physics could not, such as the photoelectric effect and blackbody radiation. Key figures like Max Planck,
                   Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Erwin Schrödinger contributed to the development of quantum theory,
                    which has since revolutionized our understanding of the universe and led to technologies like lasers and semiconductors.</p>

            <h3>Wave-Particle Duality</h3>
            <p>One of the core concepts of quantum mechanics is the wave-particle duality,
                 which states that particles such as electrons and photons exhibit both wave-like
                  and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed. For instance,
                   in the famous double-slit experiment, light behaves as a wave when not observed but as a particle when measured.
                    This dual nature challenges our intuitive understanding of reality and has far-reaching implications
                     in areas like quantum computing, where particles can be manipulated in both wave and particle forms.</p>

            <h3>Superposition</h3> 
            <p>Superposition is the principle that a quantum system can exist in multiple states at once.
                 For example, an electron can be in two different energy levels simultaneously.
                  It is only when a measurement is made that the system "collapses" into one of its possible states.
                   This principle is the foundation of quantum computing, where qubits (quantum bits) can represent both 0 and 1
                    at the same time, exponentially increasing computational power. Superposition also explains phenomena
                     like interference patterns observed in quantum experiments, where particles seem to interfere with themselves.</p>

            <h3>Quantum Entanglement</h3>
            <p>Entanglement occurs when two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle
                 instantly influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. Albert Einstein famously
                  referred to this phenomenon as "spooky action at a distance."
                   This concept challenges our classical understanding of space and time and has been experimentally
                    confirmed in numerous studies. Entanglement is a cornerstone of emerging quantum technologies,
                     such as quantum cryptography, which uses entangled particles to create virtually unbreakable communication systems,
                      and quantum teleportation, which could enable the transfer of quantum information over long distances.</p>

            <h3>Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle</h3>
            <p>The uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg, states that it is impossible to simultaneously
                 know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely one property is measured,
                  the less precisely the other can be determined. This principle is not due to limitations in measurement technology
                   but is a fundamental property of nature itself. It challenges our classical intuition that it should be possible
                    to measure both position and velocity accurately at the same time and is a direct consequence of the wave-like
                     nature of particles in quantum mechanics.</p>

            <h3>Applications of Quantum Mechanics</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quantum Computing:</strong> By leveraging the principles of superposition and entanglement,
                     quantum computers can perform calculations at speeds far beyond the capabilities of classical computers.
                      This could revolutionize industries such as cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery.</li>

                <li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> Quantum mechanics is fundamental to the operation of semiconductors,
                     which are the building blocks of modern electronics. Transistors, which power everything from smartphones
                      to computers, rely on quantum effects such as tunneling and energy band gaps.</li>

                <li><strong>Quantum Cryptography:</strong> Quantum cryptography uses quantum principles like entanglement
                     to create secure communication methods that are resistant to eavesdropping. Any attempt to intercept
                      quantum information will disturb the system, revealing the presence of a hacker.</li>

                <li><strong>Medical Imaging:</strong> Techniques such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) rely on quantum mechanics.
                     The interaction between magnetic fields and atomic nuclei provides detailed images of the inside of the human body,
                      aiding in diagnoses and medical research.</li>

                      the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, and it provided early evidence for the emerging quantum theory.</li>

                <li><strong><a href="{% url 'bohr_quantum' %}">Niels Bohr</a>:</strong> Developed the Bohr model of the atom,
                     integrating quantum concepts and explaining the behavior of electrons within atoms. His model was a crucial
                      step in the development of quantum mechanics.</li>

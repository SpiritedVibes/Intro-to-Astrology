            <h3>Jupiter: The Largest Planet in Our Solar System</h3>
            <p>Jupiter, the fifth planet from the Sun, is by far the largest in our solar system.
                 It has a diameter of 139,820 kilometers, making it more than 11 times wider than Earth.
                  Jupiter is a gas giant, composed mostly of hydrogen and helium, with a thick atmosphere made up of clouds that swirl
                   in complex patterns. The planet's most famous feature is the Great Red Spot,
                    a giant storm that has been raging for at least 400 years. With 79 moons, Jupiter's largest moons—Io,
                     Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are known as the Galilean moons. Ganymede, the largest of these moons,
                      is even bigger than the planet Mercury. Jupiter's strong magnetic field and radiation belt make its environment
                       extreme and fascinating. The planet's influence extends beyond its size, as it acts as a shield for Earth by diverting
                        comets and asteroids that might otherwise collide with our planet.</p>

            <h3>The Sun: Our Closest Star</h3>
            <p>The Sun is a massive star located at the center of our solar system and is the primary source of energy
                 for all life on Earth. It contains more than 99% of the total mass of our solar system and is composed mainly
                  of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%). Nuclear fusion occurs in the Sun's core,
                   where hydrogen atoms are fused into helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy. This energy travels
                    through the layers of the Sun and is emitted as light and heat, which sustain life on Earth.
                     The Sun has several layers, including the core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere,
                      chromosphere, and corona. The outermost layer, the corona, is seen during a solar eclipse as a halo of plasma.
                       The Sun's activity influences space weather, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections,
                        which can affect satellite communications and power grids on Earth.</p>

            <h3>The Andromeda Galaxy: Our Closest Large Neighbor</h3>
            <p>The Andromeda Galaxy is the closest large galaxy to the Milky Way, located about 2.5 million light-years away.
                 It is a spiral galaxy like ours but much larger, containing about one trillion stars.
                  Andromeda is on a collision course with the Milky Way, and in about 4 billion years,
                   the two galaxies will collide and merge to form a new, elliptical galaxy.
                    This process will cause a dramatic restructuring of both galaxies' star systems.
                     Despite being located so far away, Andromeda is visible to the naked eye from Earth on clear,
                      dark nights. Its proximity and size make it a key target for astronomers studying galaxy formation
                       and the dynamics of cosmic collisions. Andromeda also contains a supermassive black hole at its center,
                        which plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution.</p>

            <h3>Black Holes: The Mysterious Objects in Space</h3>
            <p>Black holes are one of the most mysterious and fascinating phenomena in the universe.
                 They are regions of space where gravity is so intense that not even light can escape from them.
                  Black holes form when massive stars collapse under their own gravity at the end of their life cycle.
                   The point of no return around a black hole is called the event horizon, and once something crosses it,
                    it can never escape. The size of a black hole is determined by its mass—ranging from a few times the mass
                     of the Sun to billions of times its mass. Despite their name, black holes are not "vacuum cleaners"
                      that suck up everything around them. Instead, they affect their environment by bending space-time,
                       which can lead to phenomena like gravitational lensing, where light from distant stars or galaxies
                        is warped by the black hole's gravity. Astronomers detect black holes by observing their effect on nearby
                         stars and gas clouds, as well as through the detection of gravitational waves from black hole mergers.</p>

            <h3>Hydrogen Fusion: The Sun's Energy Source</h3>
            <p>Hydrogen fusion is the process by which the Sun and other stars generate their energy.
                 In the Sun's core, hydrogen atoms are fused together to form helium through a process called nuclear fusion.
                  This process releases an enormous amount of energy in the form of light and heat, which radiates outward,
                   providing the warmth and light necessary for life on Earth. Fusion occurs at extremely high temperatures and pressures,
                    allowing hydrogen nuclei to overcome their natural repulsion and collide with enough force to fuse.
                     The Sun is constantly converting hydrogen into helium, and this process will continue for about 5 billion
                      more years before the Sun begins to run out of fuel. As the Sun ages, it will expand into a red giant
                       and eventually shed its outer layers, leaving behind a dense core known as a white dwarf.</p>

            <h3>Mars: The Red Planet</h3>
            <p>Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, is often called the "Red Planet" due to its reddish appearance
                 caused by iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has a thin atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide,
                  with traces of nitrogen and argon. Despite its thin atmosphere, Mars has seasons and weather patterns similar to Earth,
                   including dust storms that can cover the entire planet. Mars features some of the most remarkable
                    geological features in the solar system, including Olympus Mons, the largest volcano, and Valles Marineris,
                     a canyon system that stretches for 4,000 kilometers. Scientists believe that Mars may have once had liquid
                      water on its surface, and evidence of ancient riverbeds and mineral deposits suggests it may have supported
                       microbial life in the past. Numerous missions, including NASA's Perseverance rover, are currently exploring Mars,
                        searching for signs of past life and studying its geology.</p>

            <h3>The Moons of Jupiter</h3>
            <p>Jupiter has 79 known moons, ranging in size from tiny irregularly shaped objects to the four largest moons,
                 known as the Galilean moons. These moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—were first observed by Galileo Galilei in 1610.
                  They are some of the most fascinating objects in the solar system due to their size, composition,
                   and unique characteristics. Europa, for example, has an icy surface that may cover an ocean of liquid water,
                    which makes it one of the most promising places to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. Ganymede,
                     the largest moon in the solar system, has its own magnetic field, which is unique among moons.
                      Callisto, located farther from Jupiter, is thought to have a less geologically active surface,
                       but its ancient craters offer valuable clues about the early solar system.
                        These moons offer a wealth of scientific opportunities, and future missions may explore them more closely.</p>

            <h3>Venus: The Planet with the Longest Day</h3>
            <p>Venus, the second planet from the Sun, has the longest day of any planet in our solar system.
                 A day on Venus lasts 243 Earth days, which is longer than its year, which is only 225 Earth days.
                  Venus rotates very slowly on its axis in the opposite direction to most other planets,
                   meaning that if you were on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east.
                    Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid,
                     making it the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures that can exceed 465°C (869°F).
                      The planet's surface is shrouded in a thick layer of clouds,
                       preventing us from directly observing its surface from space.
                        Venus is often called Earth's "sister planet" because of its similar size, mass, and composition,
                         but its extreme conditions make it vastly different from Earth.</p>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Pluto: The Dwarf Planet</h3>
            <p>Pluto, once considered the ninth planet in our solar system,
                 was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.
                  Pluto is located in the outer reaches of the solar system, beyond Neptune, in a region known as the Kuiper Belt.
                   It has a highly elliptical orbit that sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune,
                    though their orbits are carefully timed to avoid collisions.
                     Pluto's surface is primarily made of ice and rock, with mountains, plains, and deep valleys.
                      The New Horizons mission, which flew by Pluto in 2015, provided the most detailed images and data of the dwarf planet.
                       Pluto's five known moons—Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra—orbit it in a synchronized manner,
                        with Charon being the largest and most significant moon. Despite its small size,
                         Pluto remains a source of fascination for astronomers and continues to be studied
                          for clues about the early solar system.</p>

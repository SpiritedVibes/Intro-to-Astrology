        <h2>Star Life Cycle</h2>
        <div class="info">
            <h3>Stage 1: Protostar</h3>
            <p>A star begins its life as a protostar, which forms from a cloud of gas and dust.
                 Over time, the gas and dust compress under gravity, heating up until nuclear fusion begins.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Stage 2: Main Sequence</h3>
            <p>During this phase, stars burn hydrogen into helium in their cores through nuclear fusion.
                 This is the longest phase of a star's life cycle, and our Sun is currently in this stage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Stage 3: Red Giant</h3>
            <p>Once a star exhausts its hydrogen fuel, it swells into a red giant or supergiant.
                 In this stage, the star starts fusing heavier elements, such as helium, into carbon.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Stage 4: Supernova</h3>
            <p>For massive stars, when nuclear fusion stops, the core collapses, leading to a supernova explosion.
                 This explosion can create a neutron star or black hole, depending on the mass of the star.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Stage 5: Neutron Star or Black Hole</h3>
            <p>If the star is massive enough, the supernova leaves behind a black hole.
                 If it's not as massive, it will form a neutron star, which is incredibly dense and composed mostly of neutrons.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Iron's Role in Star Death</h3>
            <p>In the final stages of a massive star's life, the core begins to fuse iron.
                 Unlike other elements, iron does not produce energy when fused, and this leads to core
                  collapse and the eventual formation of a black hole or neutron star.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Hypernova</h3>
            <p>A hypernova is an extremely powerful supernova caused by the collapse of an extremely massive star.
                 It can produce a black hole and release more energy than a regular supernova.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Neutron Stars vs. Black Holes</h3>
            <p>The key difference between a neutron star and a black hole is that a neutron star has a physical surface,
                 while a black hole does not. The event horizon of a black hole marks the point beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>Life Span of Stars</h3>
            <p>Stars with greater mass have shorter life spans, as they burn through their fuel faster.
                 Low-mass stars can last billions of years, while massive stars may only last a few million years before they explode as supernova.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info">
            <h3>The Event Horizon</h3>
            <p>The event horizon is the boundary surrounding a black hole beyond which nothing, not even light,
                 can escape. Once something crosses this point, it is lost to the black hole forever.</p>

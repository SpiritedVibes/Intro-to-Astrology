        <h1>Max Planck: The Father of Quantum Theory</h1>
        <p>Exploring the Life and Achievements of One of Physics' Greatest Minds</p>

        <h2>About Max Planck</h2>
        <p>
            Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (1858-1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of 
            **quantum theory** revolutionized physics. His work laid the groundwork for modern science, 
            including quantum mechanics and cosmology.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1900:</strong> Introduced the **Planck constant (h)** and the concept of quantized energy levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Quantum Theory:</strong> Solved the **blackbody radiation problem**, leading to the birth of quantum mechanics.</li>
            <li><strong>Nobel Prize (1918):</strong> Awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of energy quanta.</li>
            <li><strong>Planck's Law:</strong> Developed the mathematical formula to describe radiation emitted by a blackbody.</li>
            <li><strong>Influence on Modern Physics:</strong> His work inspired physicists like Einstein, Schrödinger, and Bohr.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Contributions to Science</h2>
        <p>
            Planck's work on blackbody radiation introduced the radical idea that energy is emitted in discrete packets, or **quanta**, 
            rather than a continuous wave. This challenged classical physics and led to the development of quantum mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
            His constant, **h = 6.626 x 10⁻³⁴ Js**, became one of the fundamental constants in physics, used to calculate the energy of photons:
            <br><br>
            <em>E = hv</em> (where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and v is frequency).
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Planck's discoveries paved the way for advancements in atomic and subatomic physics, quantum computing, and cosmology. 
            The **Planck satellite**, launched in 2009, honored his name by studying the cosmic microwave background radiation, 
            helping scientists understand the universe's origins.

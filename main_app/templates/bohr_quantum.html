        <h2>About Niels Bohr</h2>
        <p>
            Niels Bohr (1885-1962) was a Danish physicist and one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics. 
            His revolutionary ideas helped shape the modern understanding of atomic and subatomic systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Contributions to Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>1913:</strong> Developed the **Bohr Model of the Atom**, introducing the concept of 
                <strong>quantized electron orbits</strong> to explain atomic structure and spectral lines.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Energy Quantization:</strong> Proposed that electrons can only occupy certain discrete energy levels, 
                emitting or absorbing energy as they transition between levels.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Correspondence Principle (1920):</strong> Established the connection between quantum mechanics 
                and classical physics, showing that quantum behavior approximates classical physics at large scales.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Complementarity Principle:</strong> Argued that particles like electrons exhibit both **particle-like** 
                and **wave-like** properties, depending on the experimental setup.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bohr-Einstein Debates:</strong> Engaged in famous discussions with Albert Einstein, defending the 
                probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics against Einstein's deterministic views.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quantum Theory and Philosophy:</strong> Bohr played a critical role in interpreting quantum mechanics 
                and establishing the philosophical foundations of the Copenhagen interpretation.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact on Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
            Niels Bohr's work laid the foundation for quantum theory and atomic physics. The **Bohr Model of the Atom** 
            was a major milestone, explaining atomic spectra and paving the way for further developments in quantum mechanics.
        </p>
        <p>
            His principles of **complementarity** and the **Copenhagen interpretation** remain central to modern quantum physics, 
            influencing how we understand the behavior of particles at microscopic scales.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Niels Bohr's contributions not only revolutionized physics but also inspired generations of physicists to explore 
            the quantum realm. His legacy lives on through the modern advancements in quantum mechanics, atomic theory, 
            and particle physics.

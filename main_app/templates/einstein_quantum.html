        <h1>Albert Einstein: Contributions to Quantum Mechanics</h1>
        <p>Exploring the Legacy of the Genius Behind Modern Physics</p>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>About Albert Einstein</h2>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein (1879-1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist known for his revolutionary 
            contributions to science. While famous for his work on relativity, Einstein made groundbreaking 
            contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Contributions to Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>1905:</strong> Introduced the <strong>Photoelectric Effect</strong>, explaining how light behaves as particles (**photons**). 
                This discovery earned him the <strong>Nobel Prize in Physics (1921)</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quantum Theory of Light:</strong> Proposed that light has both **wave-like and particle-like properties**, 
                laying the foundation for quantum mechanics.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Einstein's Relation (E = hv):</strong> Showed that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency, 
                where **h** is Planck's constant.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1909:</strong> Predicted the concept of **wave-particle duality**, describing light's dual nature before its experimental confirmation.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Bose-Einstein Statistics (1924):</strong> Collaborated with Satyendra Nath Bose to predict the behavior of particles 
                (**bosons**) at extremely low temperatures, leading to the discovery of the **Bose-Einstein Condensate**.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quantum Theory Debate:</strong> Einstein famously challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics, 
                saying, <em>"God does not play dice with the universe."</em> His debates with Niels Bohr helped refine quantum theory.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact on Quantum Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
            Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect and his quantum theory of light were pivotal in proving that energy is quantized. 
            His discoveries paved the way for further advancements, such as quantum field theory, particle physics, and quantum computing.
        </p>
        <p>
            While he disagreed with the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, his challenges inspired scientists to explore and 
            better understand quantum phenomena, leading to the development of modern physics.
        </p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>
        <p>
            Albert Einstein's contributions to quantum mechanics shaped our understanding of light, matter, and energy. 
            His ideas continue to influence scientific research, technology, and cosmology.
